# Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning-Models

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose for this assignment is to creat a Neural networks, whic is a algorithms model to be able to determines if an input belongs in one category versus another.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model? 
the module is the IS_SUCCESSFUL column.

What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model? 
The features model is every model except the ones that we will drop.

What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data? The model that would be drop are the 'EIN' & 'NAME' 


How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why? 
the layers are the 80 neurons and the second has the 30 layer 


Were you able to achieve the target model performance? No I was not able 
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
The steps that I took was to make the model performance above 75%


Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
I did not achive the percentage above 75%, it was below it may an error occured with the accurcy. this may also resulted had to drop more features which may have affected how good the neural network actually is. to become more accuracy the data should be more bigger in order to get an accurency above 75%
